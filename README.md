**geometry-demo** is a lightweight Python package created as part of *Lab 4 â€” Fundamentals of Software Packaging & Testing* in the BU RISE Practicum (June 2025). The objective was to gain hands-on experience with creating Python packages, writing testable and reusable code, and practicing modern development tools including `pytest`, `setuptools`, and version control with Git.
